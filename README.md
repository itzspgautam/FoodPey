# FoodPey - A React Native Online Food Delivery App

FoodPey is a React Native app for ordering food from local restaurants. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to browse menus, place orders, and track deliveries.

## Frontend

The frontend of FoodPey is built using React Native and React Redux. The app leverages the Google Maps API to display the location of restaurants and provide a visual representation of the delivery area.

## Backend

The backend of FoodPey is powered by Node.js and Express. The server communicates with a MongoDB database to store and retrieve data, and uses Cloudinary for image storage.

## Features

FoodPey has three separate panels for users, restaurants, and administrators. Restaurants can list their menu items and manage orders, while users can browse restaurants and place orders. The administrator panel provides full management capabilities, including the ability to manage both the frontend and backend.

## Future Developments

In the future, FoodPey plans to add a delivery boy panel to track food deliveries and the Razorpay payment gateway for a seamless checkout experience.

FoodPey is an open-source project and welcomes contributions. If you have an idea or bug fix, please feel free to submit a pull request.
